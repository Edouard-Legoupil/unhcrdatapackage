# mod_home

this is a shared module that takes all the parameters to filter the data..

```{r examples-mod_home}

```

## theme_shinydashboard_unhcr

    

  

```{r example-theme_shinydashboard_unhcr}
# Typically used within the app_ui of the shiny
# app_ui <- function() {
#   tagList(
#     # Leave this function for adding external resources
#     golem_add_external_resources(),
#     ## Function to style the app
#     theme_shinydashboard_unhcr())}
```

  

  





# Shared Modules

The app includes 2 shared modules - 

  * One for the selection of countries and year - that will be then passed on to all the plots
  * One that takes the global reactive values - and the type of plot (form the library) as a parameter to output a ggplot2 charts





## mod_input

this is a shared module that takes all the parameters to filter the data..
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69172472/shiny-modules-inside-other-modules/69173076#69173076


```{r examples-mod_input}

```

## mod_plotviz

This module take as an argument the plot based on the library and the reactive values from the app. 


```{r examples-mod_plotviz}

```

## mod_share

See how we could share the story then on twitter -

This is a module that will work based on a specific module id..

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62052804/is-there-a-way-to-add-share-buttons-to-make-plots-shareable-in-shiny
The way a Twitter Card could work would be if you were sharing a link to a static web page in the Tweet text, and if that page had some markup which included the image, so that the image would be shown as a preview for the link. 


```{r examples-mod_share}

```

# Interface Componnnent

The interface component allows to navigate within the library from home page 
- typically each is behind  a series of shinydashboard::tabItem

Then each module includes different [tabsets](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/application-layout/tabsets/) for each of the pplotting functions presented
