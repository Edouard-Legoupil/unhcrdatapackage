# Divisible Content Strategy Gives You More Content With Less Work

As explained in this [blog post](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/divisible-content-strategy-gives-brand-less/), a divisible content strategy is an approach to content creation where you use a single asset to create multiple pieces. For example, you might break an e-book into a few articles, an infographic, social microcontent, or even a brand video.

The chart library is therefore designed to speed up the creation of __microcontent__ that can be then re-embedded wherever needed.

# Do not waste time with charts creation, focus on the message and on the story

Charts with impact should be focused on stry telling: https://medium.economist.com/charting-new-territory-7f5afb293270 

This can be done by: 

 *  changing charts titles and subtitle  

 *  annotating the chart: See tutorial here -> https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/ggplot2-graphic-design/materials/05_annotations.html#/annotations-with-annotate
 
 * highlighting specific part in the chart: See tutorial here -> https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/ggplot2-graphic-design/materials/05_annotations.html#/annotations-with-geom_
