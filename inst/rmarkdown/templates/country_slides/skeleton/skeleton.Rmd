Impactful charts with are characterized by their [story telling](https://medium.economist.com/charting-new-territory-7f5afb293270) ability. Using the default plots from the package, the chart effectiveness can be improved by: 

 1.  Changing charts existing default __title and subtitle__ to replace it with a key message or call to Action  

 2.  __Annotating__ the chart to provide interpretation hint around the context: See [tutorial here](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/ggplot2-graphic-design/materials/05_annotations.html#/annotations-with-annotate)
 
 3. __Highlighting__ specific parts in the chart to reinforce the main message and ease legibility: See [tutorial here](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/ggplot2-graphic-design/materials/05_annotations.html#/annotations-with-geom)_

## How the different Categories of Population of concern to UNHCR are evolving over time?
# According to official information provided by government authorities, as of December `r params$year`, the population of interest to UNHCR in `r params$country` reached `r format(round(total_poc, 0),  big.mark=",")` people. Compared to `r as.numeric(params$year)-1`, the total population `r ifelse(perc_change_poc>0, paste0("has increased ", format(round(perc_change_poc, 1),  big.mark=","), "% during the year"), ifelse(perc_change_poc<0, paste0("has decreased ", format(round(perc_change_poc, 1),  big.mark=","), "% during the year"), "has not changed"))`. Moreover, there was a `r format(round(perc_change_asy_ref, 0),  big.mark=",")`% `r ifelse(perc_change_asy_ref>0, "growth", ifelse(perc_change_asy_ref<0, "drop","change"))` of refugees and asylum seekers in the country.

## What are the main countries of Origin of Forced Displacement across Borders?

#  
# text <- The three main countries of origin for Refugees were `r top_ref[1,1]` (`r top_ref[1,3]` of the total refugee population), `r top_ref[2,1]` (`r top_ref[2,3]` of the total refugee population) and `r top_ref[3,1]` (`r top_ref[3,3]` of the total refugee population). Regarding the asylum-seeker population, the three main countries of origin for  asylum-seekers were `r top_asy[1,1]` (`r top_asy[1,3]` of the total asylum-seekers  population), `r top_asy[2,1]` (`r top_asy[2,3]` of the total asylum-seekers  population) and `r top_asy[3,1]` (`r top_asy[3,3]` of the total asylum-seekers  population).

The charts from this slide deck constitute a [chart library](https://edouard-legoupil.github.io/unhcrdatapackage/articles/chart-library.html#country-questions) can be used and re-used in reports, talking points and social medias. The charts are in vector formats and can be easily imported in specialized publication software (like Adobe, Publisher or Inkscape).

You may [enhance the charts story-telling ability](https://edouard-legoupil.github.io/unhcrdatapackage/articles/library.html) by adjusting the message in the title, highlighting specific parts of the data or adding annotation to ease interpretation or provide more contextual background.

You can [contribute](https://edouard-legoupil.github.io/unhcrdatapackage/articles/adding-new-charts.html)  to this data literacy product by reporting potential issues you may have detected, asking questions or sharing ideas for new charts to be included.
